# glaucoma_screening

No idea how to make glaucoma screening for **pre-perimetric** glaucoma cost-effective? How about **later stages**? Would it make more sense to target **disease progression** at home from health economics perspective?

## For editing documentation

Go to `README.md` and edit, see [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing. 

The **scientific background** *snippet* is found from the **[Wiki](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/glaucoma_screening/wiki)** of this repository, in order to write meaningful code.

## Simulation Init (R)

You can try to build on this (*divide axis values by 1000*), and at the moment the **clinician uncertainty** is **not** taken into account and is always 100% correct

So to establish first what are the True Positive, False Positive, False Negative, True Negative rates depending on our device specificity, glaucoma prevalence, and clinician variability in glaucoma diagnosis
